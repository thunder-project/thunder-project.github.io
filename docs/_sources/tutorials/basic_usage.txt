Basic usage
===========

Thunder offers a variety of analyses and workflows for spatial and
temporal data. We'll walk through a very simple example here as an
introduction. The entry point for most workflows is the
``ThunderContext``. If you type ``thunder`` to start the interactive
shell, this context is automatically provided as ``tsc``, which is a
thin wrapper for the ``SparkContext`` that provides functionality for
loading data.

We'll start by loading some example data:

.. code:: python

    data = tsc.loadExample('fish-series')
``data`` is a distributed collection of key-value records, each
containing a coordinate identifier and the time series of a single
voxel. We can look at the first record by using ``first()``. It's a
key-value pair, where the key is a tuple of int (representing a spatial
coordinate within the imaging volume) and the value is an
one-dimensional array:

.. code:: python

    key, value = data.first()
.. code:: python

    key



.. parsed-literal::

    (0, 0, 0)



We see that the ``first`` key in the fish ``Series`` data is the tuple
(0,0,0), corresponding to an x, y, z coordinate at an outer corner of
the volume.

.. code:: python

    value.shape



.. parsed-literal::

    (240,)



The value in this case is a time series of 240 observations, represented
as a 1d numpy array.

We can extract a random subset of voxels and plot their time series,
after applying a simple baseline normalization. Here and elsewhere,
we'll use the excellent ``seaborn`` package for styling figures, but
this is entirely optional.

.. code:: python

    %matplotlib inline
.. code:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    sns.set_context("notebook")
.. code:: python

    examples = data.normalize().subset(50, thresh=0.05)
    sns.set_style('darkgrid')
    plt.plot(examples.T);


.. image:: basic_usage_files/basic_usage_13_0.png


We can also compute the mean value for each pixel using the
``seriesMean`` method:

.. code:: python

    means = data.seriesMean()
    means.first()



.. parsed-literal::

    ((0, 0, 0), 25.824999999999999)



``means`` is now itself a ``Series``, where the value of each record is
the mean across the time series for that voxel.

For this ``Series``, since the keys correspond to spatial coordinates,
we can ``pack`` the results back into a local array. ``pack`` is an
operation that converts ``Series`` data, with spatial coordinates as
keys, into an n-dimensional numpy array on the driver node of a Spark
cluster. In this case, the result is 3d, with two planes:

.. code:: python

    img = means.pack()
    img.shape



.. parsed-literal::

    (76, 87, 2)



``pack`` is an example of a local operation, meaning that all the data
involved will be sent to the Spark driver node. For larger data sets,
this can be very problematic - it's a good idea to downsample,
subselect, or otherwise reduce the size of your data before attempting
to ``pack`` large image data sets! (See the ``Series`` tutorial for more
on how to do this.) In this case, after taking the ``mean`` the example
data set is quite small, so ``pack``\ ing it is no problem.

It's easy to look at the result directly using ``matplotlib``:

.. code:: python

    sns.set_style("white")
    plt.imshow(img[:,:,0], cmap="gray");


.. image:: basic_usage_files/basic_usage_19_0.png


It's also easy to save the result to a ``numpy`` file, or to a ``MAT``
file if you do the rest of your analysis in Matlab.

.. code:: python

    from thunder.utils import export
    export(img, "directory", "meanval", "npy")
    export(img, "directory", "meanval", "matlab")
This will put a ``npy`` file or ``MAT`` file called ``meanval`` in the
folder ``directory`` in your current directory.
